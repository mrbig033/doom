It was a long line. The kind held his close to the chest his copy of “Invaders from Outta Space”, sweating in excitement to meet his idol. When the time came he coudln’t contain his stutter, it came every time he was nervous. Jack Greene was 90 years old and look like a 100. The skin in his neck had layer upon layer. Hands trembling, Jimmy handed his copy. “So what’s wrong with you, little fella?. "Oh I got the shakes, that’s all. Mamma thinks a good hit in the head might cure me. Kids at school seem to think the same. I’m falling behind”
