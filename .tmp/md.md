How can I disable "+popup-mode" for a specific mode?

I wish to disable `+popup-mode` for buffers created by `eww`. Simply raising the buffer after created is no good because by than Eww already flowed the text according the window size, and change the window configuration it gets all mangled. 

Please do not post usage/configuration questions on Doom's issue tracker.
