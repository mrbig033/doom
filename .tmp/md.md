How can I disable "+popup-mode" for a specific mode?

I wish to disable `+popup-mode` for buffers created by `eww`. Simply raising the buffer after created is no good because by than `eww` already flowed the text according the window size, and changing the window configuration after this created gets it all mangled. 

I apologize for opening an issue for that, but I did not get an answer on Discord.
