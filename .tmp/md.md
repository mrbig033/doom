It seems to me that part of your argument can be described as an appeal to consequences: since it would be damaging for individual action to be irrelevant to society, individual action is therefore relevant.

It takes these forms:

    If P, then Q will occur.
    Q is desirable.
    Therefore, P is true.


    If P, then Q will occur.
    Q is undesirable.
    Therefore, P is false.
